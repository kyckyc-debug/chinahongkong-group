            <h2>Our Advantage</h2>
            <p>
                We charge a package price for each registration and this covers all official fees, our service fees and all related disbursements from filing up to issuance of the registration certificate. This is one of the main differences that distinguishes us from other agents and law firms in China and Hong Kong.
